    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of how efficient an algorithm is in terms of the time it takes to complete its execution. It helps us understand how the algorithm's running time increases with the input size. An algorithm with better time complexity is considered more efficient as it performs faster with larger datasets.</p>
    <p>Space complexity, on the other hand, is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It tells us how much additional memory space is required for the algorithm to run, and it's usually expressed in terms of "O notation" (e.g., O(n)). Space complexity is crucial when working with limited memory resources.</p>
    <p>In the context of space complexity, we often use the notation "O(n)" to denote linear space complexity, which means that the space required grows linearly with the size of the input data. In some cases, optimizing for space complexity may be just as important as optimizing for time complexity, especially in environments with constrained memory resources.</p>
